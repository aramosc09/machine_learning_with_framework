      "   - **Output Layer**: The final layer that produces the output or prediction.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Weights and Biases**: Each connection between neurons has an associated weight, which adjusts the strength of the input signal. Biases are additional parameters that allow the model to fit the data better.\n",

      "### Activation Functions\n",
      "Activation functions determine whether a neuron should be activated or not, introducing non-linearity into the model. Common activation functions include:\n",
      "- **Sigmoid**: Maps input to a value between 0 and 1.\n",
      "- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: Outputs the input directly if it is positive; otherwise, it outputs zero.\n",

      "2. **Loss Calculation**: The difference between the predicted output and the actual output (ground truth) is calculated using a loss function (e.g., mean squared error or cross-entropy loss).\n",
      "3. **Backpropagation**: The network adjusts its weights and biases based on the loss using optimization algorithms (like gradient descent) to minimize the error.\n",
